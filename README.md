Police Side Job - Patrol Tasks

This is not a Police Job Script but rather an additional side hustle for Police

Give your Police Department a different job to do if the city is a bit quiet! Introducing Police Side Job!

It's so easy!

Here's the step by step process on how to do it:

Talk to a local Police Officer(coords are configurable)

Get your specific task location (coords are configurable)

Patrol the Area for a certain amount of time (time is configurable)

After patrolling, receive cash for the Police Officer (number of cash is configurable)


After taking the task, you can obtain another after a certain amount of minutes (also configurable)

For issues or suggestions, contact me via discord! (Coming soon)
